The title of this site comes from Dickens’s _Great Expectations_, via the buffoonish Mr. Pumblechook:

> A man needn’t go far to find a subject, if he’s always ready with his salt-box.

It has always seemed like a useful, and usefully humbling, image for a blog. There was a previous incarnation of this at [another site](http://www.wordherders.net/), but it’s been mothballed.

Since June 2013, I have been the director of ~~educational technology~~ now Research, Instruction, Technology at Trinity College in Hartford; for the decade prior to that, I taught Victorian literature at CCSU, where I was eventually promoted to full professor. I also used to be the president of the faculty union there. On the internet, I used to write for [Bookslut](http://www.bookslut.com/blog/)and [Geekdad](http://www.geekdad/), and George Williams and I co-founded [ProfHacker](https://chronicle.com/blogs/profhacker/), which has been a going concern for a startlingly long time in internet years.

I do have some other accounts that might be interesting:
